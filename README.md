# PerlinNoise 
The goal of this project is to create visualization of the Perlin Noise algorithm, a type of gradient noise. 
The algorithm was originally created by Dr. Ken Perlin of NYU in 1983. The original algorithm suffered from second order interpolation discontinuity and unoptimal gradient
computation. However, later in 2003, he developed an improved version of the algorithm which runs faster and appears more natural.
This project uses this improved algorithm to create a visualization of the noise, displayed inside of a JFrame.
